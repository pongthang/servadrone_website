Write down your Elevator Pitch
India faces a void in core drone electronics, forcing costly imports. We’re building the first homegrown stack, a high-performance digital video link. We empower Indian makers to cut reliance on imports, ensure quality, and evolve from integrators to true technology owners.

Describe the problem you're addressing *
Explain the problem in not more than 50 words.
India lacks domestic manufacturing of core drone electronics. Reliance on imports for radio control, video transmission and propulsion causes high costs, delays, and quality risks. This void traps Indian companies as mere integrators, preventing them from transitioning into true 
technology leaders.

Describe the solution you're proposing *
Explain the solution in not more than 50 words. The solution is different from the Product you're developing.

We’re building a domestic ecosystem for core drone electronics via in-house design and local manufacturing. This cuts import reliance and costs while ensuring quality. Our modular architecture empowers Indian firms to evolve from assemblers to true technology creators who innovate.
